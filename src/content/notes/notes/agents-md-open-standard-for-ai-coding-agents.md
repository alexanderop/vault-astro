summary: "AGENTS.md provides AI coding agents with a predictable location for project-specific guidance, keeping READMEs human-focused while giving agents the detailed context they need."

## Key Insight

While README files serve human contributors with quick starts and project descriptions, AI coding agents need different information: build steps, testing procedures, code conventions, and architectural context. AGENTS.md creates a dedicated location for this agent-specific guidance, adopted by over 60,000 open-source projects.

## How It Works

AGENTS.md uses standard markdown with no required fields. Place it at your repository root, and AI agents will discover and follow its instructions. Monorepos can include nested AGENTS.md files in subdirectories—the nearest file takes precedence.

- [[context-engineering-guide]] - AGENTS.md is a form of context engineering—structuring information specifically for AI consumption
- [[12-factor-agents]] - The specification aligns with factor #1: use natural language over DSLs for agent instructions
