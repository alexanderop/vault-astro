## Key Takeaways

- **Same architecture, new capabilities**: K2.5 retains the trillion-parameter mixture of experts (32B active) from K2 but adds native multimodal training on 15 trillion mixed visual and text tokens
- **Vision-first coding**: "Coding with vision" lets you show it a website design and get code, or feed it a video workflow and have it understand and implement it
- **Agent swarm paradigm**: Spins up to 100 sub-agents executing tasks in parallel, handling up to 1,500 tool calls per session—4.5x faster than single-agent setups
- **Competitive benchmarks**: Ranks 5th on AICodeKing's leaderboard at 64%, beating Claude Sonnet 4.5 (62%) and DeepSeek V3.2
- **Cost efficiency**: $27 for full benchmark run vs $114 for Claude Opus 4.5 Max and $48 for GPT 5.2x

## Benchmark Performance

| Model               | Score   | Cost    |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Gemini 3 Pro        | 100%    | -       |
| Claude Opus 4.5 Max | 74%     | $114    |
| GLM 4.7             | 65%     | -       |
| GPT 5.2x High       | 65%     | $48     |
| **Kimi K2.5**       | **64%** | **$27** |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5   | 62%     | -       |
| DeepSeek V3.2       | -       | -       |

Official benchmarks: 96.1 on AIM 2025, 87.6 on GPQA Diamond, 85 on Live Codebench v6, 76.8 on SWEBench verified.

## Model Variants

- **K2.5 Instant**: Fast non-thinking mode (temperature 0.6)
- **K2.5 Thinking**: Reasoning mode (temperature 1.0)
- **K2.5 Agent**: Standard agent mode
- **K2.5 Agent Swarm**: Parallel agent execution (beta)

Context window: 256K tokens. OpenAI-compatible API. Weights available on Hugging Face with native int4 quantization.

## Notable Quotes

> "This is the only model that is a straight-up competitor to something like Opus because vision is always lacking."

> "For the price and the fact that it's open weights, this is pretty unbeatable."
