summary: "Agent Skills are portable instruction folders that load on demand, transforming AI agents from general assistants into domain-specific experts through scripts, examples, and specialized workflows."

## Key Takeaways

- Skills are folders containing `skill.md` files plus optional resources (scripts, images, templates)
- They load on demand when the agent detects a request matching the skill's description
- Skills are an open standard, transferable between VS Code, GitHub Copilot Cloud, and CLI agents
- Unlike static custom instructions, skills bring action-oriented automation into the mix

## What Makes Skills Different from Instructions

Custom instructions define coding standards and preferences. Skills go further: they include scripts, examples, and workflows that make agents action-oriented. A skill for image manipulation doesn't just describe preferences—it knows which ImageMagick commands to run and how to locate binaries on any machine.

## Skill Structure

```text
skills/
└── prd-writing/
    ├── skill.md          # Required: defines name, triggers, workflow
    └── helpers.js        # Optional: scripts, templates, resources
```

The `skill.md` frontmatter defines:

- **Name**: Human-readable identifier
- **When to use**: Semantic description triggering automatic loading
- **Workflow stages**: Step-by-step process the agent follows

## How Skills Load

```mermaid

    Request[User Request] --> Detect{Agent Detects<br/>Skill Match?}
    Detect -->|Yes| Load[Load skill.md<br/>+ Resources]
    Detect -->|No| Default[Standard Response]
    Load --> Execute[Execute Workflow<br/>with Context]
    Execute --> Result[Domain-Specific<br/>Output]
```

## Practical Examples

| Skill              | Purpose                                  | Resources Loaded            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| PRD Writing        | Structured product requirement documents | Workflow stages, templates  |
| Image Manipulation | Batch processing, conversions            | ImageMagick commands, paths |
| Web Testing        | Playwright interactions, test generation | Test helper scripts         |

## Notable Quotes

> "Agent skills aren't just fancy instructions. They're portable, task-specific workflows that load only when you need them."

> "Skills make agents know how to do the work and how you want it to be done."
