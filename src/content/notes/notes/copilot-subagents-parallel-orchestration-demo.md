summary: "Custom subagents with explicit model assignments and parallel execution now work in VS Code Insiders—conserving 95% of context window by delegating tasks to specialized agents."

## Summary

A VS Code Insiders user demonstrates a multi-agent orchestration system using GitHub Copilot's new custom subagent features. The setup uses different models for different roles—Sonnet 4.5 for orchestration, Gemini 3 Flash for exploration, GPT 5.2 for research—running in parallel while preserving main context.

## Key Points from OP

- **Parallel subagent execution** now works in VS Code Insiders (Jan 2026 build)
- Tasks that consumed 80K tokens in a single agent now use under 4K via delegation
- Main orchestrator (Atlas) only delegates and synthesizes—no direct work
- Subagents are defined via `[agent-name].agent.md` files with model assignments

## Agent Architecture

| Agent                 | Model          | Role                                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Atlas**             | Sonnet 4.5     | Orchestrator—delegates and synthesizes                 |
| **Prometheus**        | GPT 5.2 High   | Deep research and planning, writes to plan directories |
| **Oracle**            | GPT 5.2        | Research and analysis                                  |
| **Sisyphus**          | Sonnet 4.5     | Task execution from plans                              |
| **Explorer**          | Gemini 3 Flash | File discovery, web fetches                            |
| **Code Review**       | GPT 5.2        | Autonomous code review                                 |
| **Frontend Engineer** | Gemini 3 Pro   | UI/UX specialist                                       |

## Notable Comments

> "If anyone is wondering on the technicalities, they are just documentation files, in markdown (.md) format, which Copilot recognizes and auto-loads them on every message, if you name them `agent-name.agent.md`. The sub-agents can take Copilot to the next level in regards to its context-window."

> "What's interesting to me is not the 'parallel execution' aspect but more the context size optimization. Big functional prompts or zero-to-POC prompts are probably going to benefit the most from the system. But what about 'fix that error' prompts?"

## Model Assignment Caveat

Several commenters report that **model assignments in subagent definitions may be ignored**—subagents appear to use the main chat's model regardless of what's defined in their `.agent.md` file. One commenter tested with `reasoningEffort: xhigh` (only supported by GPT 5.2 Codex) and found subagents ran without errors even when assigned GPT 5-mini, suggesting the model setting was discarded.

## Discussion Takeaways

- **Context conservation** is the primary value—not just parallelism
- Subagent cost structure unclear: some claim subagents don't consume additional premium requests
- Enabling requires: `"chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled": true` in VS Code settings
- Nested subagents (sub-sub-agents) not yet supported
- Features currently Insiders-only, expected in public VS Code within weeks
