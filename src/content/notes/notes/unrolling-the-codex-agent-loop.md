summary: "The agent loop—a simple cycle of LLM calls and tool execution—is the core of every AI agent, but performance requires stateless design, prompt caching, and context compaction to avoid quadratic inference costs."

## Summary

Michael Bolin dissects the internals of OpenAI's Codex CLI to reveal how the agent loop actually works. The architecture is simpler than expected: an LLM receives a prompt, decides whether to call tools, executes those calls, and loops until finished. The engineering challenge isn't the loop itself—it's managing performance as conversations grow.

## The Agent Loop Structure

Every agent follows the same fundamental pattern:

**Outer loop** — User sends a prompt, system processes until the model returns a final response, then waits for new input.

**Inner loop** — Model generates output events. Tool call events trigger execution and result collection. Reasoning events get appended to context. Loop continues until a "done" event signals completion.

## Prompt Assembly

The initial prompt combines three components:

- **Instructions** — System message with coding standards and behavior guidelines
- **Tools** — List of MCP servers the agent can invoke
- **Input** — Text, images, files including AGENTS.md, environment info, and the user's message

## The Stateless Insight

Codex uses a fully stateless interaction model. Rather than relying on server-side conversation memory, it resends the entire conversation history with every request. This design choice enables model-agnostic operation—any model wrapped by the Responses API works, including locally-hosted open models.

## The Quadratic Problem

LLM inference performance is quadratic in terms of JSON sent to the Responses API over a conversation's lifetime. Without optimization, each turn processes more tokens than the last.

Two mechanisms address this:

**Prompt caching** — Reuses output from previous inference calls, making performance linear instead of quadratic. Cache misses occur when changing tools, switching models, modifying sandbox permissions, or reordering tool definitions.

**Context compaction** — When conversation length exceeds a token threshold, the agent calls a `/responses/compact` endpoint that provides a smaller representation using opaque encrypted content. Reasoning items from earlier turns get removed since models don't reuse previous reasoning.

## Key Architectural Decisions

- **Rust rewrite** — Codex CLI moved from JavaScript to Rust for improved memory and CPU usage
- **Model-specific training** — Codex models are trained specifically for their tools, with formats like `apply_patch` built directly into the model
- **Visible vs. internal reasoning** — The reasoning tokens shown to users represent only a fraction of internal processing
