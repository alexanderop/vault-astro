This is a personal knowledge base built on Zettelkasten principles. Structure emerges from links, not folders. Every note lives at the top level; type is just metadata.

## Philosophy

- **Flat structure** — No folder hierarchy. Find notes through search, links, and MOCs
- **Wiki-links are the architecture** — `[[slug]]` connections create the knowledge graph
- **Type is metadata** — A book note and an evergreen note are equals; type helps filtering, not organization

## Note Types

| Type                                    | Purpose                  | When to Use                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `book`, `article`, `youtube`, `podcast` | External content capture | Capturing insights from sources with authors         |
| `note`                                  | Personal thoughts, ideas | Quick captures, unrefined thinking                   |
| `evergreen`                             | Permanent, refined ideas | Mature insights written in your own words            |
| `map`                                   | Maps of Content (MOCs)   | Organizing 15+ related notes into navigable clusters |
| `quote`                                 | Standalone quotes        | Notable quotes worth preserving independently        |

## When to Create an Atomic Note

**One idea = one note.** If you can't summarize it in a single sentence, consider splitting.

A note deserves to exist when it's:

- **Self-contained** — Understandable without reading other notes
- **In your own words** — Synthesized insight, not copy-paste from sources
- **Linkable** — Could connect to multiple other notes

### Decision Checklist

1. Does this contain multiple distinct insights? → **Split**
2. Could different parts link to different topics? → **Split**
3. Is this over 500 words with multiple H2 sections? → **Consider splitting**
4. Is this a single cohesive argument or concept? → **Keep together**

### Splitting Patterns

Break large topics into:

- **Definition notes** — What is X?
- **Benefit notes** — Why use X? When is it valuable?
- **Challenge notes** — What are the downsides or limitations?
- **How-to notes** — Practical application of X

## When to Create a Map of Content (MOC)

MOCs are meta-notes that curate and organize related notes. Unlike folders, a note can appear in multiple MOCs.

### Create a MOC When

- **15+ related notes** exist on a topic cluster
- **Navigation is hard** — You keep losing or forgetting related notes
- **Multiple perspectives** — The same notes could be organized differently for different purposes
- **Learning path needed** — Sequential ordering helps understanding

### MOC Structure

```markdown
Brief intro explaining the topic's scope.

## Section 1

- [[note-a]] — One-line description
- [[note-b]] — One-line description

## Section 2

- [[note-c]] — One-line description

## Related MOCs

- [[another-map]]
```

## Linking Philosophy

- **Link liberally** — Aim for 3-5+ wiki-links per note
- **Contextual links** — Embed links within body text, explaining the connection
- **Related section** — Add explicit `## Related` at the bottom for key connections
- **Backlinks matter** — Every link creates bidirectional discovery

## Workflow

1. **Capture** — Create note with frontmatter, dump thoughts in notes field
2. **Process** — Write summary, extract key insights in body
3. **Connect** — Add wiki-links to related notes
4. **Refine** — Evolve notes over time; split when they grow unwieldy
5. **Organize** — Create MOCs when topic clusters emerge
