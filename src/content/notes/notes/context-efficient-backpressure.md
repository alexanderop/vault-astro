## The Problem

Test, build, and lint output consumes excessive tokens without providing useful information to AI agents. A single passing test generates dozens of lines the agent must parse, wasting context for minimal signal.

## The Smart Zone

Claude models perform optimally within a ~75k token range. Every redundant line diminishes agent performance and moves closer to context exhaustion.

## The `run_silent()` Solution

A bash wrapper that:

- Suppresses successful command output (shows only checkmark)
- Displays full output only on failure
- Provides deterministic control over what reaches the agent

## Practical Techniques

- **Fail-fast modes**: Use `pytest -x` or `jest --bail` to surface one failure at a time
- **Filter output**: Remove unnecessary stack frames and timing info
- **Framework-specific parsing**: Extract only meaningful data

## Key Insight

> "Every token you use is diminishing the results and moves you closer to needing to clear or compact to get back to the smart zone."

Deterministic pre-filtering beats reactive truncation. Design intentional backpressure rather than letting models waste tokens on defensive output handling.
