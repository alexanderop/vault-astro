## Overview

A practical guide to 12 design patterns specifically for Vue development, addressing problems that basically every app has.

## The 12 Patterns

### 1. Data Store Pattern

Creates a global state singleton using composables. Expose selected state through `toRefs`, keep some state private, and provide methods to modify underlying values while maintaining encapsulation.

### 2. Thin Composables

Separates reactivity management from business logic—use pure functions for core logic with a minimal reactivity layer on top. Improves testability and reusability.

### 3. Humble Components

Focuses components on presentation and user input. Follow "Props down, events up" principles for clear data flow.

### 4. Extract Conditional

Simplifies templates with multiple branches by extracting each conditional path into separate components.

### 5. Extract Composable

Moves component logic into composables even for single-use cases. Facilitates adding related methods like undo/redo while keeping logic separate from UI.

### 6. List Component Pattern

Abstracts `v-for` loop logic into dedicated child components, reducing parent complexity.

### 7. Preserve Object Pattern

Passes entire objects as props instead of individual properties. Simplifies components and future-proofs them, though creates structural dependencies.

### 8. Controller Components

Bridges UI (Humble Components) and business logic (composables). Manages state and interactions while orchestrating application behavior.

### 9. Strategy Pattern

Uses dynamic component switching via `<component :is>` based on runtime conditions for complex conditional logic.

### 10. Hidden Components

Splits complex components into smaller ones when different property sets are used exclusively together.

### 11. Insider Trading

Simplifies overly coupled parent-child relationships by inlining child components into parents when appropriate.

### 12. Long Components

Components become problematic "when it becomes too hard to understand." Encourages self-documenting, clearly named components.
