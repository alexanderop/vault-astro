summary: "Slash commands turn repetitive AI prompts into reusable, instantly-triggerable shortcuts—store them once, invoke them forever across Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, and Codex."

Slash commands let you define custom commands for repeatable processes. Instead of constantly retrieving stored prompts and pasting them manually, you create a command file once and invoke it by name.

## How They Work

Command files require frontmatter metadata:

- **Description** of what the command does
- **Argument hints** for expected parameters
- **Allowed tools** the agent can execute
- **Model designation** (optional)

The filename maps directly to the command name. `fix-pr-comments.md` becomes `/fix-pr-comments`.

## When to Use Them

- Manual workflow triggering needed
- Simple, repetitive tasks
- Frequent prompt reuse

## Directory Locations by Tool

| Tool        | Global Commands                | Project Commands           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/commands`           | `project/.claude/commands` |
| Cursor      | `~/.cursor/commands`           | `project/.cursor/commands` |
| Gemini      | `~/.gemini/commands`           | `project/.gemini/commands` |
| Codex       | `~/.codex/prompts`             | `project/.codex/prompts`   |
| OpenCode    | `~/.config/opencode/commands/` | `.opencode/commands/`      |

Note: Some platforms like Codex have deprecated this feature.
