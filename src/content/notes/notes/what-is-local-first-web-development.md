## Key Concepts

**Local-first** represents a fundamental shift from traditional web apps that rely heavily on backend servers. Instead, data lives on the user's device first, with optional sync to the cloud.

### The Seven Ideals of Local-First

1. **Instant access** - No loading delays waiting for servers
2. **Device independence** - Seamless cross-device access
3. **Network independence** - Full offline functionality
4. **Built-in collaboration** - Real-time collaboration support
5. **Future-proof data** - Long-term data preservation
6. **Security and privacy by design** - Data protection from the ground up
7. **Full user control** - Users own and control their data

## Application Types

- **Local-only apps**: Store data exclusively on devices (offline-first, but not truly local-first)
- **Sync-enabled apps**: Maintain local copies while automatically synchronizing with cloud services

## Implementation Approach

1. Convert SPAs into Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
2. Implement robust storage beyond localStorage (IndexedDB, SQLite via WebAssembly)
3. Build authentication and synchronization systems
4. Prioritize encryption for sensitive data

## Technologies

- SQLite with WebAssembly
- Dexie.js (IndexedDB wrapper)
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- IndexedDB
