## Summary

Drizzle ORM added support for Cloudflare's Durable Objects with SQLite, enabling developers to use a proper ORM and migration system instead of custom database management code. Griffin integrated this into his SprintJam application, replacing unreliable custom code that made updates difficult.

## Key Concepts

- **Durable Objects**: Cloudflare's solution for stateful edge computing, now with SQLite support
- **Repository Pattern**: A central class initializes Drizzle with `DurableObjectStorage` and handles all database operations
- **Migration Safety**: The `blockConcurrencyWhile()` wrapper ensures migrations complete before handling any requests

## Code Snippets

### Drizzle Configuration

The config specifies SQLite dialect with the Durable Objects driver.

```typescript
// drizzle.config.ts
export default {
  dialect: "sqlite",
  driver: "durable-sqlite",
  // ... schema and output paths
};
```

### Repository Initialization

Wrap migration in `blockConcurrencyWhile()` to prevent concurrent requests during schema updates.

```typescript
class Repository {
  private db: DrizzleDatabase;

  constructor(storage: DurableObjectStorage) {
    this.db = drizzle(storage);

    storage.blockConcurrencyWhile(async () => {
      await migrate(this.db, migrations);
    });
  }
}
```

## Gotchas

- **Concurrency**: Always wrap migrations with `blockConcurrencyWhile()` to prevent race conditions
- **Deployment**: Include `drizzle-kit generate` in your deployment pipeline
- **SQL Imports**: Use the `?raw` suffix for SQL file imports if you encounter parsing errors
