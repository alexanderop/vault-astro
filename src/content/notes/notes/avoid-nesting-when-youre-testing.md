summary: "Nested describe blocks with beforeEach hooks create cognitive burden by requiring developers to track mutable state across scope levels—prefer inline setup or factory functions instead."

## Summary

Kent C. Dodds argues against using nested `describe` blocks with `beforeEach` hooks for code reuse in tests. The pattern creates cognitive overhead: developers must mentally track variable assignments across multiple scope levels. "Where is `handleSubmit` coming from and what's its value?" becomes a frustrating question when variables are assigned in outer hooks and reassigned in nested ones.

## Key Concepts

- **Over-abstraction harms tests**: Utility functions like `changeUsernameInput()` add indirection without proportional benefits for simple scenarios
- **Mutable state breeds confusion**: Variable reassignments across nested scopes reduce cognitive capacity for actual test logic
- **Duplication beats wrong abstraction**: Explicit, self-contained tests are more maintainable than DRY tests with hidden state

## Code Snippets

### The Problem: Nested State

Variables assigned in outer `beforeEach` blocks become difficult to trace.

```javascript
describe("User Form", () => {
  let handleSubmit;
  beforeEach(() => {
    handleSubmit = jest.fn();
  });

  describe("when submitted", () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      // Where did handleSubmit come from? What's its current value?
    });
  });
});
```

### The Solution: Setup Functions

Return objects containing test utilities through composition.

```javascript
function setupSuccessCase() {
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn();
  const utils = render(<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />);
  // ... perform actions
  return { ...utils, handleSubmit };
}

test("submits form with valid data", () => {
  const { handleSubmit } = setupSuccessCase();
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

## When Hooks Are Appropriate

`beforeAll`/`afterAll` have valid uses:

- Server startup and shutdown
- Mocking `console.error` across test suites

The key: pair setup with cleanup, don't use hooks as code-reuse mechanisms.
