summary: "Production-quality vibe coding requires strict CI/CD pipelines, git discipline, extensive planning, and expert oversight—code is 30% of the work, deployment and performance are the real challenges."

## The Question

A developer with a $1,000 budget asks how to vibe code a SaaS product to production quality, planning to hire a real dev for auditing afterward.

## Staff Engineer Advice (63 upvotes)

u/fredandlunchbox, a staff engineer using AI tools extensively, provides the most upvoted response:

**Tooling:** Claude Code with Opus 4.5 on the $200 plan is sufficient.

**Git discipline is non-negotiable:** Learn basic git commands, commit after every major working change, and know how to revert. This is your undo function when the AI breaks things.

**Planning over prompting:** Don't jump straight to code. Write clear plan docs and update them as the project progresses.

**Be realistic about scale:** "Must scale to a billion users" is fantasy. Start with 10 concurrent users and expand from there.

**Technical guardrails:**

- Favor a mono repo
- Use TypeScript for better guardrails and ecosystem support
- Verify libraries—avoid esoteric packages with 2 stars and years-old updates
- Have the AI write a clear CLAUDE.md

**The sobering truth:**

> "You're definitely in over your head. Writing code is like 30% of the work. The rest is knowing how to build performant software and how to deploy it."

AI tools excel with expert guidance but struggle to produce quality output independently. The risk: what you save using AI might cost more when deployment loops cause $3,000 cloud fees.

## CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

u/ZealousidealShoe7998 emphasizes strict deployment discipline:

```text
feature branch → DEV → QA → STAGING → PROD
```

- Agents can add features freely to dev branches
- QA requires regression tests before anything advances
- Staging focuses on stability and performance
- Nothing reaches production without passing the full lifecycle

## Community Consensus

Several commenters reinforce the same message:

> "Vibe works, but need heavy guardrails and rigorous rules." — u/ThisGuyCrohns (17-year engineer)

> "You don't vibecode for production code. You code using the LLM as an assistant." — u/bot_exe

> "Claude Code is good, but also a liar." — u/Ginger_Libra, who uses multiple LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude Desktop) and throws answers back into Claude for verification

## Tools and Frameworks Mentioned

- **[[why-prompting-breaks-down-and-bmad-doesnt|BMAD]]** — Multiple commenters recommend this spec-driven methodology
- **[[ralph-wiggum-loop-honest-reviews|Ralph Wiggum]]** technique — Mentioned as "the new hotness" for iterative AI development
- **Cloudflare full stack** — One user recommends ditching Cursor entirely for API-based Claude Code with parallel GLM-4.7 agents

## Key Insight

The thread reveals a paradox: vibe coding promises speed but demands discipline. The engineers who succeed with it treat AI as a tool requiring supervision, not a replacement for understanding deployment, performance, and architecture.
