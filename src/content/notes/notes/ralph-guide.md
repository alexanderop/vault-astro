summary: "The Ralph Wiggum technique: a bash loop that runs AI agents autonomously, resetting context each iteration to stay in the 'smart zone'"
date: 2026-01-11
---

Ralphs ships code while you sleep. Created by [[authors/geoffrey-huntley|Geoffrey Huntley]], this technique runs AI coding agents in a loop—each iteration gets fresh context, implements one task, commits, and repeats. Results: $50K contracts completed for $297 in API costs, 6 repos shipped overnight, entire programming languages built autonomously.

## The Core Insight

Context windows are arrays. When you chat, you allocate to the array. When tools execute, they auto-allocate. The LLM slides a window over this array—**the less sliding required, the better the results**.

Ralph exploits this by resetting context between iterations. Each task gets the full "smart zone" instead of degrading as context fills.

```bash
while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions; done
```

## Tools

## Pure Ralph vs Plugin Ralph

A critical distinction:

- [[ralph-wiggum-and-why-claude-codes-implementation-isnt-it]] - Why Anthropic's plugin differs: outer orchestrators reset context fully, inner plugins use lossy auto-compaction

## When NOT to Use

From [[ralph-wiggum-loop-honest-reviews|community discussion]]:

- Exploratory work without clear outcomes
- Major refactors without explicit acceptance criteria
- Security-critical code requiring human review
- Brownfield codebases with complex implicit requirements

Ralph works best for greenfield projects with auto-validatable success criteria.
