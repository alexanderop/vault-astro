summary: "Traditional front-end engineering (hand-coding pages from Figma designs) is being replaced by composability—designing primitives, schemas, and contracts that let AI, PMs, and designers ship dynamic interfaces without reinventing the wheel."

## Core Argument

The era of front-end engineers hand-implementing pages is ending. AI coding assistants, schema-driven UIs, and component systems like Shadcn are collapsing that work into something cheap and repeatable. What replaces it is **composability**: designing the primitives, schemas, and contracts that let entire organizations ship new interfaces.

## Key Mental Model Shifts

1. **From data schemas → screens**: Think about the mutability profile of your UI schema—the allowable range of views across different data queries, not just shepherding one view into production.

2. **From pixel-perfect → brand promises**: Work with designers to ensure the brand system is expressed reliably across hundreds of dynamically composed pages.

3. **From design patterns → workflows**: Think in recipes. Enable as many good workflows as possible based on your data in brand-compliant ways.

4. **RBAC reimagined**: The front-end should no longer decide what users can or cannot do. You need role security and auditability baked into a composable platform—assuming both agentic and human users.

5. **AI as consumer**: Agents will be 99% of the attention on your tool. Think about API consumption, computer use agents, permission inheritance, and how to deliver your brand promise headlessly.

## The New Front-End Engineer Role

- **System designer, not ticket taker**: Choose and shape primitives; define acceptable button variant ranges; design the vocabulary of your interface
- **Workflow modeler**: Drive dynamic flows, tables, and forms by extending schemas rather than hand-coding pages
- **AI integration architect**: Set guardrails for where AI can generate UIs and where it can't; ensure brand-appropriate generation
- **UX instincts at scale**: Care about layout thrashing, input latency during generation, keyboard accessibility across a thousand variants, and inherent predictability

## Where Classical Front-End Survives

- **High-polish consumer products**: Custom rendering, intricate interactions, careful performance tuning
- **High-traffic mission-critical surfaces**: Every line needs human review; bespoke attention to error states, semantics, keyboard flows
- **Regulated/safety-critical domains**: Healthcare, finance—auditability must be built in from day one

## Connections

Relates to [[12-factor-agents]]—both discuss designing systems for AI agents as first-class consumers, not just human users. Factor 11 (trigger from anywhere) and Factor 7 (contact humans with tool calls) align with the composability vision of enabling agentic and human users to interact with the same underlying system.
