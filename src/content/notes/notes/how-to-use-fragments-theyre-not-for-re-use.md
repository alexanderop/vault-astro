summary: "GraphQL fragments describe data requirements for components, not reduce code duplication. Reusing fragments causes overfetching. Use fragment models, collocate GraphQL with code, and write GraphQL that mirrors your component structure."

## Key Insights

1. **Fragments are for composition, not reuse** — Each component should own exactly one fragment describing its data needs
2. **Shared fragments create hidden coupling** — When two components share a fragment, changes for one affect the other
3. **Fragment models catch bugs at compile time** — Unlike type models, they only expose fields you explicitly requested
4. **Collocation enables automatic cleanup** — Delete a component, delete its fragment spread—no orphaned data fetching
5. **Mirror code structure in GraphQL** — Functions become fragments, field access becomes fields, child calls become spreads

## Core Message

The GraphQL spec says fragments "allow for the reuse of common repeated selections of fields." This misses the point. Fragments are for **modular definition of each component's data needs** to prevent over and underfetching.

## Why Reuse Causes Problems

### Overfetching Creep

Two functions use the same fields today, so you create a shared fragment. Tomorrow one function needs a new field. You add it to the shared fragment. Now the other function fetches data it never uses.

What seemed like DRY code created an **implicit dependency** between unrelated functions. At scale with many developers, this compounds into significant overfetching.

```graphql
# ❌ Shared fragment - seems DRY but causes problems
fragment UserFields on User {
  id
  name
  avatar # Added for ProfileCard
  email # Added for SettingsPage
  lastLogin # Added for AdminDashboard
}

# ProfileCard fetches email and lastLogin it never uses
# SettingsPage fetches avatar and lastLogin it never uses
```

### Unused Field Detection

When a fragment maps to one component, detecting unused fields is fast. When a fragment spreads across the codebase, checking if any field can be removed requires scanning everything. This blocks automated unused field linting—a key GraphQL benefit.

## Three Tips from Meta

### 1. Use Fragment Models, Not Type Models

A **fragment model** generates accessors only for fields in the fragment. A **type model** exposes all fields on the schema type.

Fragment models catch underfetching at compile time. If you access a field not in your fragment, you get an error—prompting you to add it and actually fetch the data.

```typescript
// Type model: exposes ALL fields, no safety
const user: UserType = data.user;
user.email; // ✓ Compiles, but crashes if not fetched!

// Fragment model: exposes ONLY fetched fields
const user: ProfileCard_user = data.user;
user.email; // ✗ Compile error - field not in fragment
```

### 2. Collocate GraphQL with Code

Put each component's fragment next to that component. Relay enforces this: even if a parent spreads a child fragment, the parent cannot access the child's fields.

When you delete a component, you delete its fragment spread. No orphaned data fetching.

```tsx
// ProfileCard.tsx
const ProfileCard_user = graphql`
  fragment ProfileCard_user on User {
    name
    avatar
  }
`;

function ProfileCard({ user }: { user: ProfileCard_user }) {
  return <img src={user.avatar} alt={user.name} />;
}
```

### 3. Write GraphQL That Mirrors Your Code

Translate client code directly into GraphQL:

- Each function/component → a fragment
- Field accesses → fields in the fragment
- Child component calls → fragment spreads
- Conditionals → `@skip` / `@include` directives

```tsx
// Component structure
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  if (user.isAdmin) {
    return <AdminBadge user={user} />;
  }
  return <ProfileCard user={user} />;
}

// Mirrors directly to GraphQL
fragment UserProfile_user on User {
  isAdmin              # conditional check
  ...AdminBadge_user   # child component spread
  ...ProfileCard_user  # child component spread
}
```

## Handling Objections

**"Won't queries get larger?"**

- Field collection deduplicates during execution—repeated fields resolve once
- Use persisted documents to avoid sending large queries over the wire
- Optimize duplicates during the persist step if parsing cost matters

**"Fragment models increase binary size"**

- Fragment models matter most at dev time for compile-time checks
- Production builds can merge models into type models via compiler optimization

**"What about generic interfaces?"**

- Sorting functions that work on any list need fields like `createdAt`
- This creates friction with strict collocation—an open problem Meta is solving with [[async-defer-even-more-matt-mahoney-meta|generic fragments]]

## Key Insight

Fragments are not for reuse. They are for **accurate data requirement description and composition**.
