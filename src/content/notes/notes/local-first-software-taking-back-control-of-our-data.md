summary: "Local-first isn't just offline capability—it's a paradigm shift where data lives on user devices by default, servers become optional infrastructure, and CRDTs enable collaboration without sacrificing ownership."

## Core Message

Cloud software made us renters of our own data. Local-first software reverses this: data lives on your device first, syncs through servers optionally, and survives even when the developer disappears. CRDTs make this possible by merging concurrent edits automatically.

## Key Takeaways

- **The spark came from frustration** - Adam Wiggins recalls music stopping mid-tunnel because the streaming app required a server connection. "Where did my playlist go? Why have we done this to ourselves?"

- **CRDTs dissolved the ownership-collaboration tradeoff** - Martin Kleppmann discovered conflict-free replicated data types through an algorithms paper and realized they could give "power back to users again."

- **The name crystallized a movement** - What started as "serverless software" became "local-first" in 2019 when Ink & Switch published the foundational essay. The name gave scattered efforts a rallying point.

- **Production apps prove the model** - Figma and Linear dominate their categories precisely because local-first architecture delivers instant responsiveness. They invested millions building custom sync engines—frameworks like Jazz now democratize access.

- **Servers become supporting cast** - Local-first doesn't mean serverless. Cloud infrastructure handles backup, discovery, and bridging between devices. The shift: servers support rather than own.

- **End-to-end encryption becomes natural** - When data lives locally and servers only sync encrypted blobs, privacy stops being a feature layered on top and becomes intrinsic to the architecture.
