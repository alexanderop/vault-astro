## Overview

GitHub's official curated collection of Copilot customizations. The repository aggregates community contributions that extend Copilot beyond its defaults: specialized agents for specific workflows, task-specific prompts, coding standard instructions, and portable skill bundles.

The project ships an MCP Server for direct installation into VS Code, allowing users to browse and install customizations without leaving the editor.

## Key Features

- **Agents**: Specialized Copilot agents integrating with MCP servers for workflow-specific capabilities
- **Prompts**: Task-specific prompts accessed via `/` command in Copilot Chat
- **Instructions**: Pattern-based rules that auto-apply to matching files
- **Skills**: Self-contained folders bundling instructions with resources
- **Collections**: Curated sets combining prompts, instructions, agents, and skills by theme

## Code Snippets

### Installing via MCP Server

The repository provides Docker-based installation for direct editor integration:

```bash
# Clone and run the MCP server
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/github/awesome-copilot-mcp
```

### Using a Prompt

```text
# In Copilot Chat
/awesome-copilot create-readme

# The prompt loads and guides README generation
```
