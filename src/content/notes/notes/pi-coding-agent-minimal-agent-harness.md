summary: "Minimal coding agents outperform bloated ones because frontier models already understand agentic coding—so the harness should stay out of the way with fewer than 1,000 tokens of system prompt and just four tools."

## Summary

Mario Zechner built pi, a minimal coding agent harness split into four packages: a unified LLM API, an agent loop core, a terminal UI framework, and the CLI itself. His guiding principle—"if I don't need it, it won't be built"—produces a system that competes with Cursor and Codex on Terminal-Bench 2.0 despite radically less complexity. The article doubles as an architectural teardown and a design philosophy manifesto.

## Key Concepts

### Four-Package Architecture

pi splits into focused packages rather than a monolith:

- **pi-ai** — Unified API across Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, and Groq, with cross-provider context handoff and token/cost tracking
- **pi-agent-core** — Agent loop orchestration with event streaming and transport abstraction
- **pi-tui** — Retained-mode terminal UI with differential rendering (redraws only changed lines)
- **pi-coding-agent** — The CLI itself, under 1,000 tokens of system prompt and four tools

### Radical Minimalism in System Prompts

The system prompt totals fewer than 1,000 tokens. Zechner argues frontier models have been RL-trained enough to understand coding agents inherently—long system prompts just waste context.

### Four Tools Only

The entire tool surface: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`. No search tool, no sub-agents, no background processes. The thesis: models handle tool orchestration well when the toolset stays small and composable.

### Opinionated Design Rejections

Each omission comes with a rationale:

- **No MCP support** — MCP servers consume 13.7k–18k tokens of context per server. CLI tools with README files provide progressive disclosure without the cost.
- **No plan mode** — Collaborative planning through editable PLAN.md files gives better observability than ephemeral planning modes.
- **No sub-agents** — Mistakes in sub-agents become invisible. Separate sessions preserve transparency.
- **No built-in to-dos** — File-based task tracking via markdown persists across sessions and remains visible.
- **No background bash** — Synchronous execution; tmux substitutes for process management.

### YOLO Mode as Default

Full filesystem access without permission prompts. Zechner's argument: if an LLM has access to tools that can read data and execute code, sandboxing is whack-a-mole. The only real protection would be cutting off all network access, which makes agents mostly useless.

## Code Snippets

### Differential Rendering Algorithm

The terminal UI avoids full redraws by tracking state line-by-line.

```text
1. Find first differing line from previous render state
2. Move cursor to that position
3. Redraw from there to end of content
4. Handle scrollback buffer constraints
```

Uses synchronized output escape sequences to eliminate flicker—a retained-mode approach rather than the immediate-mode pattern most TUIs use.

- [[how-to-build-a-coding-agent]] — Shares the thesis that coding agents are fundamentally simple loops, though Huntley's workshop adds tools incrementally while Zechner caps the toolset at four
- [[12-factor-agents]] — Contrasting philosophy: 12 Factor Agents advocates micro-agents in deterministic workflows, while pi rejects sub-agents entirely in favor of session-level transparency
