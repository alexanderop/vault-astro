Since March 2025, I've been completely obsessed with AI coding. I've consumed hundreds of articles, tutorials, and podcasts on the topic. This roadmap distills everything I learned into a clear progression from beginner to advanced practitioner.

## Level 1: Foundation

Start here. Understand what AI coding actually is before diving into tools.

### Understanding LLMs

Before you use AI coding tools, understand how they work:

- [Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) - Andrej Karpathy walks through the complete pipeline from internet data to inference. Essential viewing.
- [Andrej Karpathy — We're summoning ghosts, not building animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXUZvyajciY) - Karpathy explains why current AI agents will take a decade to mature. Calibrates your expectations.
- [What Is ChatGPT Doing... and Why Does It Work?](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/123245371-what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work) - Stephen Wolfram breaks down tokenization, embeddings, and the paradox of understanding.

### Core Concepts

- [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) - Anthropic's definitive guide explains the difference between workflows and agents. Read this first to build the right mental model.
- [12 Factor Agents](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/12-factor-agents) - HumanLayer's manifesto for production-grade agents. Teaches you that effective AI coding combines deterministic software with strategic LLM decision-making.

### Pick Your First Tool

Choose one and stick with it for at least a month:

**GitHub Copilot** (VS Code)

- Best for: VS Code users who want inline completions and chat
- Start with: [Using Agents in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/overview) to understand the four agent types

**Claude Code** (Terminal)

- Best for: Developers who prefer terminal workflows and want deeper customization
- Start with: [Advent of Claude: 31 Days of Claude Code](https://adocomplete.com/advent-of-claude-2025/) - a 31-day progression from basics to advanced

**Cursor**

- Best for: Developers who want an all-in-one AI-native IDE
- Start with: [Build and Deploy a Cursor Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf9rHPNBMyQ) to understand how it works under the hood

## Level 2: Basic Usage

Master the fundamentals before moving to advanced patterns.

### Essential Skills

1. **Write clear prompts** - Be specific about what you want. Include context about your codebase.
2. **Use plan mode** - Think before coding. Let the AI propose an approach before implementation.
3. **Review every change** - Never blindly accept AI suggestions. You own the code.

### Claude Code Basics

- Learn `/init` to generate your first `CLAUDE.md` file
- Master `!` prefix for instant bash execution
- Use `--continue` to resume sessions
- Practice `Escape` to rewind mistakes

### VS Code Copilot Basics

- [Prompt Files in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files) - Create reusable `.prompt.md` files for common tasks
- [Context Engineering Guide for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/guides/context-engineering-guide) - Microsoft's guide to feeding the right context

## Level 3: Context Engineering

This is where most developers plateau. Context engineering separates productive AI coders from frustrated ones.

### The Core Principle

AI models have limited attention. Every token counts. Feed them exactly what they need—nothing more, nothing less.

### Key Resources

- [Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) - Anthropic's guide treats context as a finite budget
- [Advanced Context Engineering for Coding Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents) - Research-Plan-Implement workflow for complex codebases
- [No Vibes Allowed: Solving Hard Problems in Complex Codebases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmvDxxNubIg) - Practical framework for intentional context compaction

### Configuration Files

Every AI coding tool reads project-specific instructions. Master these:

- **CLAUDE.md** - [Writing a Good CLAUDE.md](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md) and [The Complete Guide to CLAUDE.md](https://www.builder.io/blog/claude-md-guide)
- **AGENTS.md** - [AGENTS.md: Open Standard for AI Coding Agents](https://agents.md/) - The open standard adopted by 60,000+ projects
- **.github/copilot-instructions.md** - Custom instructions for Copilot

### Key Insight

Don't dump your entire codebase into context. Use progressive disclosure—start minimal and add context only when needed.

## Level 4: Skills and Extensions

Extend your AI coding tool with reusable workflows.

### Claude Code Skills

- [Mastering Subagents in VS Code Copilot](https://imaginet.com/2025/mastering-subagents-in-vs-code-copilot-how-to-actually-use-them/) - Isolated, autonomous task execution

### Safety

Before going autonomous, learn to protect yourself:

- [Claude Code Damage Control](https://github.com/disler/claude-code-damage-control) - PreToolUse hooks for guardrails

## Level 5: Advanced Patterns

Now you're ready for multi-agent orchestration and autonomous loops.

## Final Advice

Start simple. The most effective AI coding setups are often the simplest. Add complexity only when you hit real limitations.

The goal isn't to automate yourself out of thinking—it's to amplify your thinking. You remain the architect. The AI executes.
