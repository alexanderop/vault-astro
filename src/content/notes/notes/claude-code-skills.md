summary: "Official documentation on Skills—markdown files that extend Claude Code with specialized knowledge and workflows, triggered automatically based on semantic matching."
date: 2026-01-11

Skills are markdown files that teach Claude how to do something specific. Unlike slash commands requiring explicit invocation, Skills activate automatically when Claude determines a request matches the Skill's description.

## Key Concepts

**Automatic Triggering**: Claude loads only Skill names and descriptions at startup. When a request semantically matches a description, Claude asks permission, then loads the full `SKILL.md` content.

**Storage Locations**:

- `~/.claude/skills/` — Personal (all projects)
- `.claude/skills/` — Project (shared with team)
- Plugin directory — Bundled with plugins
- Enterprise managed settings — Organization-wide

Precedence flows top-to-bottom: Enterprise wins over Personal wins over Project wins over Plugin.

## Creating a Skill

Minimum structure:

```text
my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

The `SKILL.md` file requires YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this does and when to use it. Include trigger keywords.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
# My Skill

```

### Metadata Fields

| Field           | Required | Purpose                                                      |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`          | Yes      | Lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars                        |
| `description`   | Yes      | Max 1024 chars. Include trigger keywords users would say     |
| `allowed-tools` | No       | Restrict Claude to specific tools without permission prompts |
| `model`         | No       | Specific Claude model for this Skill                         |

## Progressive Disclosure

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Offload details to reference files:

```text
pdf-processing/
├── SKILL.md           # Overview and navigation
├── FORMS.md           # Form-filling details
├── REFERENCE.md       # API documentation
└── scripts/
    └── fill_form.py   # Executes without loading into context
```

Scripts in the `scripts/` directory execute with zero context cost—their code never loads into Claude's context window.

## Skills vs Other Options

| Option         | Trigger         | Use Case                        |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Skills         | Auto (semantic) | Specialized knowledge           |
| Slash Commands | Manual (`/cmd`) | Reusable prompts                |
| CLAUDE.md      | Always loaded   | Project-wide instructions       |
| Subagents      | Delegated       | Isolated context with own tools |
| Hooks          | Event-driven    | Scripts on tool events          |
| MCP Servers    | Tool calls      | External integrations           |

Use Skills for guidance that should apply automatically. Use subagents when isolation matters.

## New in 2.1 (January 2026)

Claude Code 2.1 brought major skill improvements:

- **Hot-reload**: Skills created or modified in `~/.claude/skills` or `.claude/skills` are immediately available without restarting the session
- **Forked context**: Run skills in isolated sub-agent context using `context: fork` in frontmatter
- **Agent specification**: New `agent` field to specify agent type for execution
- **YAML-style allowed-tools**: Cleaner declarations using list syntax in frontmatter
- **Progress display**: Skills show tool uses as they happen during execution
- **Scoped hooks**: Hooks for `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop` events, enabling fine-grained state management and audit logging
