## Key Takeaways

- **Skill hot-reloading** eliminates session restarts when adding or editing skills—edit and test in the same session
- **Forked sub-agents** via `context: fork` enable parallel task execution with isolated contexts that don't pollute the main conversation
- **Async agents** run in the background using the async flag or Ctrl+B, perfect for long-running tasks like monitoring logs or builds
- **Chrome browser integration** lets Claude Code control a real browser—navigate pages, fill forms, interact with web apps, and debug
- **LSP support** brings language server protocol intelligence to the terminal experience
- **Hooks in skill frontmatter** support `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop` events scoped to skill lifecycle
- **Claude Desktop integration** provides a GUI experience powered by Claude Code in the desktop app's "code mode"
- **AskUserQuestion tool** enables Claude to ask clarifying questions during coding sessions instead of guessing
- **Output styles** let you configure response verbosity—concise for speed, explanatory for learning
- **Teleport command** transfers sessions between terminal, desktop app, and web

## Notable Quotes

> "Instead of just having a single agent loop, you have way more flexibility which is definitely going to increase efficiency."

> "You can have one agent that could be coding while the other agent watches a live web flow in Chrome that reports back to the other agent."

## Tools Mentioned

Three third-party tools highlighted for enhancing Claude Code:

- **Claude Mem** - Persistent memory for Claude Code
