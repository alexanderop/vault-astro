## Core Philosophy

Composables remain functions at their core—leverage established software design principles rather than inventing new patterns.

## Key Rules

### Naming & Organization

- **File naming:** Prefix with `use`, PascalCase (e.g., `useCounter.ts`)
- **Composable naming:** Descriptive, intention-revealing (`useUserData()` not `useData()`)
- **Folder structure:** Dedicated `src/composables/` directory

### Arguments & Structure

- **Object arguments:** Use when passing 4+ parameters for clarity
- **Consistent ordering:** Refs → Computed → Methods → Lifecycle hooks → Watchers

### Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility:** Each composable has one reason to change
- **Separation of Concerns:** Manage state/logic only; leave UI operations to components
- **Error Handling:** Expose error state rather than swallowing errors internally

### Composable Anatomy

1. **Primary State:** Core reactive data
2. **Supportive State:** Loading, error, status indicators
3. **Methods:** Functions updating state and calling external services

## Functional Core, Imperative Shell

Isolate pure, side-effect-free logic from Vue-specific operations. This pattern improves testability and maintainability significantly.
