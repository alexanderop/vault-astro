summary: "Step-by-step walkthrough for installing and using the Ralph Loop plugin with Claude Code, enabling autonomous iterative development through a stop-hook mechanism."

## What Ralph Loop Does

Ralph Loop forces Claude Code to operate in a continuous intelligent loop. Instead of stopping when it believes output is "good enough", Claude keeps working until the task meets explicit completion criteria. The plugin uses a stop hook that blocks exit and feeds the same prompt back.

## Installation

1. Install Claude Code: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/code/install | sh`
2. Ensure you're on version 2.0.76+ to access `/plugins`
3. Run: `/plugin install ralph`
4. Verify with `/plugin` to see Ralph listed

## Usage

```bash
/ralph loop "Build me a REST API for todos" done
```

The five-step cycle:

1. Claude attempts the task
2. Tries to exit
3. Stop hook blocks exit
4. Same prompt feeds back
5. Repeats until completion criteria met

## Prompt Best Practices

**Clear completion criteria** — Don't say "make it good". Specify exact requirements: crude operations, input validation, tests, etc.

**Incremental goals** — Break work into phases the agent can achieve step by step.

**Self-correction patterns** — Instead of "write code for feature X", use: implement feature, write failing test, run test, fix until passing.

**Max iterations** — Always set a limit to prevent runaway token usage.

## Results Demonstrated

A paint tool comparison: standard Claude Code (single pass) produced basic brush/size features. With Ralph Loop enabled, the same prompt generated spray effects, shapes, text, emoji support, image enhancement, and photo imports.

Real-world examples cited:

- $50K outsourcing contract completed for $297 in AI costs
- Created an esoteric programming language ("Gen Z") in 30 hours of autonomous operation
- 6 repositories shipped overnight during a Y Combinator hackathon

## Connections

Ralph Loop is the plugin implementation of the [[ralph-wiggum-as-a-software-engineer]] technique by Geoffrey Huntley. See [[stop-chatting-with-ai-start-loops-ralph-driven-development]] for methodology on structuring prompts for loop-based development. Contrast with [[12-factor-agents]], which argues for deterministic workflows over "loop until solved" patterns.
