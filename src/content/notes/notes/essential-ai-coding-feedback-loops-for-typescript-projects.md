summary: "AI coding agents working autonomously need feedback loops to verify their own work—TypeScript for type errors, Vitest for logic bugs, and Husky to enforce both before every commit."

When AI coding agents operate independently, they need mechanisms to verify their own work. Matt Pocock outlines three essential feedback loops for TypeScript projects.

## The Core Problem

AI agents working AFK (away from keyboard)—like those using the Ralph Wiggum technique—can't test changes in a browser. They need automated feedback to catch errors before they compound.

## Three Feedback Loops

### 1. TypeScript Over JavaScript

TypeScript provides free feedback. Type errors surface problems the AI would never find without manual browser testing. The type system acts as a constant sanity check on the agent's work.

### 2. Vitest for Logic Errors

Types catch structural mistakes but miss logical ones. A test framework like Vitest fills this gap. Basic unit tests covering core functionality keep the AI on track when reasoning fails.

### 3. Husky Pre-commit Hooks

Husky enforces these feedback loops before every commit. The agent cannot push broken code—it must fix issues first.

```bash
# Install and initialize Husky
npx husky init

# Create pre-commit hook
echo "pnpm typecheck && pnpm test" > .husky/pre-commit
```
