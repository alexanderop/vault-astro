- Title/description signals: "podcast", "episode", "ep.", "#123", "today's guest"
- Duration 1-3 hours with conversation format

## Metadata Collection

**Agent A - Episode Metadata:**

- For YouTube podcasts: `.claude/skills/adding-notes/scripts/get-youtube-metadata.sh`
- For Spotify/Apple: WebFetch to extract title, show name, description

**Agent B - Podcast Profile Check:**

```bash
ls src/content/notes/podcasts/ | grep -i "show-name-slug"
```

If NOT found → see `references/podcast-profile-creation.md`

**Agent C - Platform URLs:**
Search for episode on multiple platforms:

- Spotify: `site:open.spotify.com "Episode Title"`
- Apple: `site:podcasts.apple.com "Episode Title"`
- YouTube: `site:youtube.com "Episode Title" "Show Name"`

**Agent D - Transcript Sourcing:**

| Priority | Source           | Method                                                                  | Quality |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 1        | YouTube version  | `python3 .claude/skills/adding-notes/scripts/get-youtube-transcript.py` | High    |
| 2        | Show notes page  | WebFetch episode URL                                                    | Medium  |
| 3        | Spotify native   | Chrome extension JSON                                                   | High    |
| 4        | Description only | Spotify/Apple metadata                                                  | Low     |

**Step 1:** Search for YouTube version

```text
WebSearch: "{episode_title}" "{show_name}" site:youtube.com
```

**Step 2:** Fetch show notes from podcast website

```text
WebFetch: {podcast.website}/{episode-slug}/
```

Extract: timestamps, links/resources, sponsors

**Step 3:** Parse timestamps

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/adding-notes/scripts/get-podcast-transcript.py --parse-timestamps <<< "$SHOW_NOTES"
```

**Step 4:** Set `transcript_source` field based on what was available.

## Content Structure by Podcast Type

| Type          | Focus                             | Examples                    |

## Validation

Episode-specific validator checks:

- `podcast` field references existing profile in `src/content/notes/podcasts/`
- Warn if guest appears in podcast's hosts list (unusual)
- Warn if episode has no guests and no authors (unclear attribution)

---

## Notes

- Always try YouTube first for transcript
- Parse timestamps from show notes even without full transcript
- Multi-platform URLs improve discoverability
- See `references/podcast-profile-creation.md` if show profile doesn't exist

---

## Diagram Evaluation

**Priority: MEDIUM** — Podcasts occasionally present frameworks worth visualizing.

**Look for these triggers:**

- Guest describes a named methodology or framework
- Discussion of a process or workflow
- Mental model or decision framework explained
- Host/guest draws on whiteboard or references a visual

**Common skip reasons:**

- Discussion-based without visual concepts
- News/commentary format
- Interview without framework content

**Log outcome:** `✓ Diagram added: [type] - [description]` or `✓ No diagram needed: [reason]`
