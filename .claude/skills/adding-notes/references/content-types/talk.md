## Content Structure by Talk Type

### Technical Talks (conference presentations)

- Focus on Key Arguments with examples
- Extract code snippets if shown on slides
- Note any tools/libraries mentioned
- If technical with code visible, set `isTechnical: true` and see `references/code-extraction.md`

### Keynotes/Vision Talks

- Focus on thesis and implications
- Capture memorable quotes
- Connect to broader industry trends

### Panel Discussions

If truly conversational with multiple speakers:

- Consider using `type: podcast` instead
- See `content-types/podcast.md`

## Notes

- Use transcript for accurate quotes and specific examples
- Speaker goes in `authors`, not `guests`
- Conference field helps with searchability and context

## Diagram Evaluation

**Priority: HIGH** — Talks frequently present visual models on slides.

**Look for these triggers:**

- Speaker draws on whiteboard or shows diagram slide
- References to "let me show you how this works"
- Named frameworks or methodologies
- Architecture explanations
- Process demonstrations
- Comparisons of approaches (before/after, old/new way)

**Mermaid types commonly used:**

- `graph TD` — Hierarchies, organizational structures
- `flowchart LR` — Processes, workflows, pipelines
- `graph LR` with subgraphs — Comparisons, before/after

**Log outcome:** `✓ Diagram added: [type] - [description]` or `✓ No diagram needed: [reason]`
