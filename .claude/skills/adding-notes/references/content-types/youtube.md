## Diagram Evaluation

**Priority: HIGH for tutorials (isTechnical: true), MEDIUM for standard**

**Tutorial triggers:**

- Step-by-step process shown on screen
- Architecture being built or explained
- Workflow demonstration
- Component relationships explained
- Data flow visualization

**Standard video triggers:**

- Named frameworks discussed
- Process or methodology explained
- Comparison of approaches

**Mermaid types commonly used:**

- `flowchart LR` — Build processes, workflows
- `graph TD` — Architecture, component hierarchies
- `sequenceDiagram` — API calls demonstrated

**Log outcome:** `✓ Diagram added: [type] - [description]` or `✓ No diagram needed: [reason]`
