### Response Handling

| Response              | Set Fields                                                                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 (Want to read)      | `readingStatus: want-to-read`                                                     |
| 2 (Currently reading) | `readingStatus: reading`, ask for `startedReading`                                |
| 3 (Already finished)  | `readingStatus: finished`, ask for `finishedReading`, optionally `startedReading` |

### Date Input Handling

Accept these formats and normalize to YYYY-MM-DD:

- `today` → current date
- `skip` → leave field empty
- `2025-12-15` → use as-is
- `12/15/2025` → normalize to YYYY-MM-DD
- `December 15, 2025` → normalize to YYYY-MM-DD

## Diagram Evaluation

**Priority: HIGH** — Books commonly present visual frameworks.

**Look for these triggers:**

- Named models ("The Habit Loop", "The Golden Circle", "The Flywheel")
- Numbered frameworks ("Four Laws of...", "Five Dysfunctions of...", "Three Pillars of...")
- Circular/cyclical relationships described in text
- Pyramids, matrices, or layered structures
- Before/after transformation processes

**Example from Atomic Habits:**
The "Habit Loop" (Cue → Craving → Response → Reward → reinforces Cue) was diagrammed as:

```text
graph LR
    C[Cue] --> CR[Craving]
    CR --> R[Response]
    R --> RW[Reward]
    RW -.->|Reinforces| C
```

**Log outcome:** `✓ Diagram added: [type] - [description]` or `✓ No diagram needed: [reason]`
