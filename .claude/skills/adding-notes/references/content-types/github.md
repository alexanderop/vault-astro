# GitHub Repositories

GitHub projects and repositories.

## Detection

- URL contains: github.com
- Type auto-detected as `github`
- Always `isTechnical: true`

## Metadata Collection

**Agent A - Repo Metadata:**

```bash
.claude/skills/adding-notes/scripts/get-github-metadata.sh 'URL'
```

**Agent B - Author Check:**

```bash
.claude/skills/adding-notes/scripts/check-author-exists.sh 'owner'
```

**Agent C - Code Extraction** (always runs):
Extract installation and usage examples from README (see `references/code-extraction.md`).

## Code Snippet Rules

**Always include 1-3 snippets** from README showing:

1. Installation command
2. Basic usage example
3. Configuration (if relevant)

See `references/code-extraction.md` for detailed guidelines.

## Special Features

**GitHub Card**: Notes with `type: github` automatically display a card with:

- Language badge
- Star count
- Repository link

## Diagram Evaluation

**Priority: MEDIUM** — GitHub repos may have architectural concepts worth visualizing.

**Look for these triggers:**

- README describes architecture
- Multi-component system
- Plugin/extension architecture
- Data flow through the system
- Pipeline stages

**Common skip reasons:**

- Simple utility library
- Single-purpose tool
- Documentation already includes diagrams (don't duplicate)

**Log outcome:** `✓ Diagram added: [type] - [description]` or `✓ No diagram needed: [reason]`
