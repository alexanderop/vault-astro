## Diagram Evaluation

**Priority: HIGH** — Courses often have structured learning paths and methodologies.

**Look for these triggers:**

- Module/lesson progression structure
- Methodology or framework being taught
- Architecture patterns (technical courses)
- Workflow or process demonstrations
- Before/after skill transformations

**Common diagram opportunities:**

- Learning path: `flowchart LR` showing module progression
- Methodology: `graph TD` showing framework structure
- Architecture: `graph TD` with subgraphs for components

**Log outcome:** `✓ Diagram added: [type] - [description]` or `✓ No diagram needed: [reason]`
