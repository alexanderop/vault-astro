summary: "Martin Kleppmann traces local-first from CRDTs to a proposed definition: software where another computer's availability never blocks the user—including when the developer shuts down."

Martin Kleppmann, co-author of the original [[local-first-software]] essay, reflects on five years of local-first development and proposes a sharper definition.

## Core Message

Local-first software must survive not just network outages, but the complete disappearance of its creators. The solution is commoditized sync infrastructure with open protocols that let users switch providers freely.

## Key Insights

1. **A Clearer Definition** (3:45) - The original seven ideals described benefits, not a definition. Kleppmann proposes something crisper: "In local-first software, the availability of another computer should never prevent the user from working."

2. **Three Requirements for True Local-First** (6:12) - Software must be multi-device (syncs between devices), offline-capable (works without network), and "Incredible Journey proof" (survives developer shutdown).

3. **CRDTs Are Necessary But Not Sufficient** (8:45) - Skiff, built on yjs CRDTs, still shut down when Notion acquired it. Technology alone doesn't guarantee resilience—the entire architecture must be built for independence.

4. **Self-Hosting Isn't the Answer** (15:22) - Self-hosting requires technical skills most users lack, and even skilled users don't want to run servers. It's a partial solution at best.

5. **The Vision: Commoditized Sync** (22:30) - Generic syncing services that any local-first app can use, speaking standardized open protocols. Multiple providers would interoperate like email.

6. **Provider Switching Freedom** (26:15) - Users should be able to switch sync providers by changing a single configuration flag, without losing data or functionality.

7. **Peer-to-Peer as Enhancement** (30:40) - P2P works brilliantly for devices on the same table but struggles with NAT and firewalls. Use it opportunistically alongside cloud sync for redundancy.

8. **Radical Developer Simplification** (35:18) - Local-first eliminates backend engineering teams, network error handling, server operations, on-call rotations, and cloud infrastructure bills.

9. **Small Teams, Big Apps** (38:45) - With simplified architecture, small teams can build impressive apps for niche audiences. Prototypes emerge in weeks instead of months.

10. **The Data Moat Weakens** (42:10) - When users own their data, the traditional "data moat" business model fails. Companies must compete on user experience instead.

## Talk Structure

1. **Opening** (0:00) - Introduces the problem of cloud dependency and "Our Incredible Journey" shutdowns
2. **Historical Context** (3:45) - Reviews the original 2019 essay and its seven ideals
3. **Defining Local-First** (6:12) - Proposes the new three-part definition
4. **Case Studies** (8:45) - Examines Skiff's failure and why technology wasn't enough
5. **The Solution** (22:30) - Presents commoditized sync infrastructure vision
6. **Developer Benefits** (35:18) - Explains the simplified development model
7. **Business Implications** (42:10) - Discusses how local-first changes startup economics
8. **Conclusion** (45:00) - Call to action for the local-first community

## Notable Quotes

> "A distributed system is one in which a failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable." (5:30)

> "We want to make sure that the users can always continue doing their work regardless of whether they have an internet connection and regardless of whether the servers of the software developer disappear." (7:15)

> "Self-hosting is not the answer. Even people with the skills often don't want to run servers." (16:45)

## Who Should Watch

This talk is essential for software architects and developers building collaborative applications who want to understand the full vision of local-first beyond just "works offline." It's particularly valuable for startup founders evaluating technical architecture decisions that affect long-term user trust and data ownership. No prior local-first knowledge required—Kleppmann explains the fundamentals clearly.

## Action Items

- [ ] Read the original local-first essay if you haven't already
- [ ] Audit your current applications for "Incredible Journey" vulnerability
- [ ] Evaluate sync infrastructure options that support open protocols
- [ ] Consider local-first architecture for your next collaborative feature
- [ ] Join the local-first community to follow protocol standardization efforts
